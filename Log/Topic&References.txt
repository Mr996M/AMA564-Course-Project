[1] Meshless methods for American option pricing through Physics-Informed Neural Networks. 
DOI: 10.1016/j.enganabound.2023.02.040
this article is most useful I think, we can mostly follow its track and do some improvement.

this article is also a good reference that we can follow

hints(only for self-understanding):
1.高维的含义：在普通欧式期权(2D)中，只有股票价格和时间两个维度，亚式期权（3D）多了一个路径依赖变量A的维度，随即波动率模型如Heston模型也是3D多了一个随机波动率变量vt。
至于多标的资产菜篮子期权，其维度为N+1（N个标的资产+时间t）
