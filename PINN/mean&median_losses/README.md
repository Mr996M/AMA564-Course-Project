### Loss Values
In this directory, we have uploaded losses data from experiments (.xlsx files from 1D to 4D folder) and bar charts of the mean and median of these loss values from 1D to 4D.

### Relationship among boundary conditions
In these bar charts, each attribute represents the loss value of each boundary condition, where Free Boundary and Total are the sum of loss values of different boundary conditions:
\
`Free Boundary = FB_Init + FB_Dir + FB__Neu`
\
`Total = Unsupervised + Initial + Dirichlet + FB_Dir + FB_Neu`

### Observation and discovery
To get a better view of the data, we set the specific thresholds to zoom in on bar charts within these areas to see the tiny data.
\
By observing the data in bar charts, we find that in high-dimensional data models, there are anomalies where the mean and median differ greatly for certain conditions.
