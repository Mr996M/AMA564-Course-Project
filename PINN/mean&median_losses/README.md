In this directory, we have uploaded losses data from experiments (.xlsx files) and bar charts of the mean and median of these data from 1D to 4D.
\
\
In these bar charts, each attribute represents the loss value of each boundary condition, where Free Boundary and Total are the sum of loss values of different boundary conditions:
\
`Free Boundary = FB_Init + FB_Dir + FB__Neu`
\
`Total = Unsupervised + Initial + Dirichlet + FB_Dir + FB_Neu`
